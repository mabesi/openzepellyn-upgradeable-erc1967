# OPENZEPPELIN MULTI TOKEN ERC-1155

A professional solidity Multitoken [ERC-1155 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) contract example based on OpenZeppelin library.

## :speech_balloon: Description

<p align="justify">ERC-1155 is a widely adopted standard for fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed as an improvement to the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, combining the functionalities of both into a single standard.</p>
<p align="justify">OpenZeppelin Contracts helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards.</p>
<p align="justify">This project is a simple implementation of OpenZepplein ERC-1155 standard, with the most important functionalities for an Multi Token Smart Contract, to help you save time in coding.</p>

### üõ†Ô∏è Features

In addition to the basic functionalities of an NFT contract, such as mint, burn, balance and transfer, these are the main features of an ERC-721A smart contract:

- **Optimization 1** - Removing duplicate storage from OpenZeppelin‚Äôs (OZ) ERC721Enumerable
- **Optimization 2** - updating the owner‚Äôs balance once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT
- **Optimization 3** - updating the owner data once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT

### üèóÔ∏è Built With

The core of this project was built using all these great tools:

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Ethereum Programming Language
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed Programming Language
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - Development Environment for Ethereum software
- [Ethers.js](https://ethers.org/) - Web3 Library
- [OpenZepellin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) - Web3 Solidity Contract Libraries
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript Runtime Environment

In addition, in order to function fully and satisfactorily, this project uses resources from the following services:

- [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) - IPFS File Sharing

## Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js
- CLI/Terminal
- IDE or Text Editor
- Wallet address in an EVM compatible chain
- Balance to deploy the Smart Contract

### :arrow_down: Install

Not applicable.

### :gear: Configuration

Clone the `.env.example` file into a new `.env` file.
After this, adjust the `SECRET` with your seed phrase, `API_KEY` with your API Key (get it in a production block explorer), `RPC_URL` with the RPC url of your chain  and `CHAIN_ID` with the Chain ID of the chain.

```bash
# MetaMask mnemonic 12-word phrase
SECRET=

# Blockchain API Key (get in EtherScan, BSC Scan, SnowTrace, ...)
API_KEY=

# RPC Server URL (e.g. "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc")
RPC_URL=

# RPC Chain ID (e.g 43113)
CHAIN_ID=
```

Change the `currentSupply` for the three token types initial supply and the `tokenPrice` for your desired initial value.

```solidity
    uint[] public currentSupply = [50, 50, 50];
    uint public tokenPrice = 0.01 ether;
```

After create the [Metadata URI JSON Schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification), adjust the `BASE_URI` address for your own address.

```solidity
    string public constant BASE_URI = "ipfs://myuriaddress/";
```

And, finally, change the Contract URI metadata address:

```solidity
    function contractURI() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "ipfs://mycontracturiaddress/";
    }
```

### üë®‚Äçüíª Testing

To test your OpenZeppelin ERC-1155 smart contract run this command:

```bash
$ npm test
```

To test and view the tests coverage of your OpenZeppelin ERC-1155 smart contract run this command:

```bash
$ npm run cov
```

### üë∑ Deploy

To deploy your OpenZeppelin ERC-1155 smart contract run this command:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

With the deployed contract address in the hands, run this command to verify it:

```bash
$ npm run verify <contract_address>
```

### :arrow_forward: Usage

You can interact with your deployed contract in two ways

1. By your chain's block explorer

- Find the Contract Address: First, you need to know the address of the deployed smart contract. This address is a hexadecimal string (e.g., 0x123abc...) and serves as the unique identifier for the contract on the blockchain.
- Open the Block Explorer: Choose a blockchain block explorer that supports the network where your contract is deployed. Examples of popular block explorers are Etherscan for Ethereum and BscScan for Binance Smart Chain. Go to the website of the block explorer you want to use.
- Search for the Contract Address: In the search bar of the block explorer, enter the contract address you want to interact with and click "Search" or a similar button. The block explorer will display the contract's details, including its code, transactions, and events.
- Interacting with Functions: If the smart contract has public functions that can be called, the block explorer might provide a user interface to interact with those functions. You may need to look for a "Read Contract" or "Write Contract" section. In some block explorers, this feature is available in the "Contract" or "Smart Contract" tab.
  - Read Functions: For read-only functions (functions that don't modify the state), you can call them directly from the block explorer's interface, and it will display the returned value.
  - Write Functions: To interact with write functions (functions that modify the state), you will need to provide the necessary parameters and possibly your wallet's signature for authentication. After filling in the required details, submit the transaction.
- Transaction Confirmation: When you send a transaction to the contract, the block explorer will provide a transaction hash. You can use this hash to track the status of the transaction on the blockchain. It may take some time for the transaction to be mined and confirmed by the network.
- View Transaction History and Events: The block explorer will also show the transaction history of the contract, including all past interactions. Additionally, if the contract emits events, you can find and explore those events in the block explorer to see the details of each event occurrence.

_It's essential to be cautious when interacting with smart contracts, especially when executing write functions, as blockchain transactions are irreversible. Always double-check the inputs and the contract's behavior to avoid unintended consequences.
Keep in mind that the specific steps and options available for interacting with a smart contract through a block explorer may vary based on the block explorer's design and the features supported by the underlying blockchain network._

2. Use the [Mabesi Azuki NFT DApp](https://github.com/mabesi/dapp-nft) as your Frontend interface user. This DApp was made with React/Next.js to be integrant part of this NFT smart contract.

### üîß Troubleshooting

Contracts published on the blockchain are immutable. Thus, if it is necessary to correct any errors or make any changes, you must deploy again, generating a new contract address and reinitializing all state variable information.

It is possible to perform data migration in case of a new deployment of the contract, but for this you must make a plan, performing the backup beforehand and creating a migration script.
